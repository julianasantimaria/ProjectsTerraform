# Individual Infrastructure as Code projects

This repository contains a series of Infrastructure as Code files that I made to allocate resources in the Cloud: AWS, Azure and GCP.

## Overview

There are several individual projects for allocating resources in clouds through code. 

Each project has its particularity in the amount of resources, cloud, network, subnet, IAM, region of the allocated resource, etc. In some projects, the code may allocate resources to different characteristics at once. 

The advantage of increasing resources in this way is the guarantee of CI/CD control, cost control and greater control of all allocated resources, creating ease and agility in the process.

## Project Structure

The structuring of this repository is difficult and requires no Frontend, Backend, Data, Data Science or Machine Learning Development.

These are evolutionary projects for allocating resources in the cloud through code.

## Requisites

Make sure you have Docker and Terraform tools and accounts in the Azure, AWS and GCP clouds.

```bash
- Docker
- Terraform
- AWS
- GCP
- Azure
